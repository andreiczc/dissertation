# Notes

## Ideas for tinyML

- predict earthquakes based on earth movement -> maybe RNN, more investigation necessary
- using a CNN to track employees coming and leaving (LeNet5 in tf lite converted to tinyML model)

## Securing PSK

- deleting the psk associated with the client doesn't affect the connection
- as soon as the client is connected, delete that and CHECK THE MEMORY

## Things to remember

0x04 is Uncompressed point indicator!
